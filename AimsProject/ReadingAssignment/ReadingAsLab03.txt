1. Advantages of Polymorphism:
- Allows the same method to work with objects of different types.
- Simplifies code by using a common interface for different classes.
- Enhances flexibility and extensibility without modifying existing code.

2. How Inheritance Achieves Polymorphism:
- Inheritance allows subclasses to override methods from a superclass.
- This enables polymorphism, where a superclass reference can point to subclass objects and invoke the correct method based on the objectâ€™s actual type.

3. Differences Between Polymorphism and Inheritance:
- Inheritance is about creating a hierarchy (parent-child relationship) for code reuse.
- Polymorphism allows different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way, achieved using inheritance or interfaces.
